# 1337b0t
does 1337 things

Pending Tasks:

!channel_default ~ save a default server for the channel
  ~ update all other commands (status, cmd) to get this default
  ~ perhaps update get_servers to set channel defaults named default_guildid_channelid, so functions could attempt to get those first
!delete_channel_default

!admin add/remove/list @username (remove should work with just username and no @ for discretion)
!op server add/remove/list @username
  ~ op array should contain objects like: {name: 'keith', id: 12345} to allow removing via saved name (using @ will remove via user_id)

!list_permissions
  ~!permissions
  ~!perms

!dm_toggle enable owner/admins to toggle requiring DMs
